# MSLatch
AMATH/BIOL 382 Final Project

Application of the Master-Slave Latch on a theoretical genetic toggle switch in the Drosophila Gap Gene Network involving the Hunchback (Hb), Giant (Gt), Kruppel (Kr) & Knirps (Kni) genes.

run_sim.m runs the simulation and calculates the expression levels of the genes at different time points along with phase portraits.

mslatch.m contains the coarse-grained nonlinear system of differential equations modelling the Master-Slave Latch. Modify the if statement to perform operations. The operations are SET (Kr ON), Reset (Gt ON) & Toggle (Kr, Gt ON).
